# Geometry Dash Wii

This is a clone of Geometry Dash for the Wii. The goal for this clone is to remain as close to the original as is reasonable, while retaining optimal performance on the Wii.

## Setting Up

This game does not include any assets. All game assets must be provided and placed in the appropriate directory. Currently this directory structure is not provided, but it will be further into development.

## Building

This project uses DevKitPro and libogc for building. Be sure to install these before continuing.

With all the game textures placed in the `textures` directory, type `make` and everything should be built.

## Important Note

This project is in early stages, so there is minimal documentation and resources.
